Material for the 2020 fall edition of the course "Introduction to Python and Human Language Technologies" at BME AUT 

## Lab solutions

We do not release the solutions for the lab exercises but we welcome contributions from students.

Contribution guidelines are the following:

- Each solution must be a standalone .py file with a solution to a single exercise.
- It must be named LABNUMBER\_EXERCISENUMBER\_NAMEOFFUNCTION.py. Lab01 exercises weren't numbered, you can skip the number in this case.
- It must have a copyright notice with your name and email (see my example).
- It must be submitted as a pull request to the master branch in the [this repository](https://github.com/bmeaut/python_nlp_2020_fall). In order to submit pull requests, you need to fork this repository and push to your own fork. You can then submit a pull request to the this repository.
- It must follow PEP8.
- It must include and pass all tests for that particular exercise in the notebook.
- It must have a main entry point (see the [example](https://github.com/bmeaut/python_nlp_2020_fall/blob/master/lab_solutions/01_get_first_n_primes.py) and a separate function for the solution. You can use helper functions.
- We will provide code review on Github (this is why it needs to be plain text, not a notebook). You are expected to answer our review and fix your mistakes. Accepted solutions will count as extra points towards your final grade.
- Alternate solutions are fine as long as they significantly differ from other solutions (for example an iterative solution vs a recursive one). Please use a numbered suffix if you submit an alternative solutions. An example would be `01_get_first_n_primes_2.py`
- We may change the directory and naming conventions if the number of solutions starts to get out of hand. We will update the guidelines accordingly.
- Here is an [example](https://github.com/bmeaut/python_nlp_2020_fall/blob/master/lab_solutions/01_get_first_n_primes.py).
